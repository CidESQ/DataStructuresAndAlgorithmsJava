Data Structure (DS): a way of organizing data so it can be used effectively. 
Big-O Notation;
* Constant Time: O(1)
* Logarithmic Time: O(log(n))
* Linaer Time: O(n)
* Linearithmic Time: O(nlog(n))
* Quadratic Time: O(n^2)
* Cubic Time: O(n^3)
* Exponencial Time: O(b^n). b>1
* Factorial Time: O(n!)
